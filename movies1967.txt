The year '''1967 in film''' involved some significant events. It is widely considered as one of the most ground-breaking years in film{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}.

==Events==
* The prototype for the [[IMAX]] large-format-film acquisition and screening system is exhibited at [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]], Canada
* The MPAA uses a new logo and is still used today.
* August 13 — ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', starring [[Warren Beatty]], [[Faye Dunaway]], and [[Gene Hackman]], premieres. It broke many taboos that had been controversial, at its time, over the film's glorification of violence. In spite of that, it has been considered a landmark film in Hollywood filmmaking with its groundbreaking and ingenious filmmaking styles and because of that, ''Bonnie and Clyde'' brought forth the [[New Hollywood]] era, which is considerably been cited as the greatest era motion picture filmmaking in cinema history.
* October 18 — [[Walt Disney]]'s production of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' premieres. It was the last animated feature film to be personally supervised by Disney himself before his untimely death, the year prior. It was also the one of the last Disney films to be personally supervised by him, the others being ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]]'' and ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]''. The story's moral message of friendship, love, and trust have embraced critics and audiences worldwide, as they needed all that during the very difficult and troubled times of the 1960s. ''The Jungle Book'' is very famous for its groundbreaking achievements in realistic character animation, voice acting, and choice of voice casting. [[The Jungle Book (soundtrack)|The film's soundtrack]], which includes songs like the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]]-nominated "[[The Bare Necessities]]", '"[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)|I Wan'na Be Like You]]", "Trust in Me", and "[[My Own Home]]", have also contributed to the film's enormous success, as well. It would the last acclaimed and successful animated film to be made by Disney until ''[[The Rescuers]]'', ten years later.
* December 21 — ''[[The Graduate]]'', starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] (in his acting film debut), [[Anne Bancroft]], and [[Katharine Ross]], premieres. Its story of a man with a no-aimed in life, seduced and betrayed by an older woman, and fell in love with her daughter who seemed to help him to find the right path to follow in his life with the strength and will of his own, resonated and embraced Americans as they needed a new hope and direction in life after when [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963]] and America was divided into two. ''The Graduate'' was one of some films released in 1967 that broke many [[taboo]]s that had not been shown previously in American cinema, and more significantly, it represents as the bridge between traditional (pre-1967) and groundbreaking (1967 and onward) achievements filmmaking.
* December 26 — [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'' airs on British television.
