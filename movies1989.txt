{{Yearsinfilm}}
* This is the first year where all ten top grossing films worldwide made more than $100,000,000.
* Actress [[Kim Basinger]] and her brother Mick purchase [[Braselton, Georgia]], for $20 million. (Basinger would lose the town to her partner in the deal, the pension fund of [[Chicago]]-based Ameritech Corp., in [[1993 in film|1993]] after being forced to file for bankruptcy when a California judge ordered her to pay $7.4 million for refusing to honor a verbal contract to star in the film ''[[Boxing Helena]]''.)
* April 23 - Sports classic ''[[Field of Dreams]]'', starring [[Kevin Costner]], [[James Earl Jones]], and [[Burt Lancaster]], is released, striking an emotional chord in men and fans of baseball.

* June 13 - The [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' is released. Unknown to anyone at the time, its release would be followed by years of legal wrangling over the future of the popular film series. The next Bond film, ''[[GoldenEye]]'', is not released until 1995.
* June 16 - ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' is released.
* June 23 - ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' is released, going on to gross over $410 million worldwide, and establishing the public and critical attention of director [[Tim Burton]].
* June 23 - ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' is released and marked the directorial debut of visual effects supervisor [[Joe Johnston]], who later went on to direct ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'', ''[[Jumanji]]'', ''[[October Sky]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'', and ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''.

The first installment of the [[Disney Renaissance]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', became an astounding critical and commercial success and brought a new life to [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] after suffering nearly three decades of humiliation and despair with films like ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. It became Disney's most successful and acclaimed animated film since ''[[The Rescuers (film)|The Rescuers]]'' and vigorously relaunched a profound new interest in the animation film genre after notable examples like ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]]'', ''[[An American Tail]]'', ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'', ''[[Oliver and Company]]'', and ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', as well as the musical film genre. Following many other remarkable accomplishments since when [[Roy E. Disney]], [[Michael Eisner]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], and [[Frank Wells]] joined to take charge in 1984, ''The Little Mermaid'' also reinvigorated a new public and critical interest in [[The Walt Disney Company]], which went on to become one of the most highly successful and prestigious companies of the 1990s.
* November 22 - ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' is released and is the 2nd installment of the [[Back to the Future series]].
