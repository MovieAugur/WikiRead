The year '''1963 in film''' involved some significant events.

==Events==
* February 20 – The classic epic western ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' premieres.
* June 12 – ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Richard Burton]] premieres at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City. Both its staggering production costs, nearly bankrupted, and extremely troubled production history soured the reputation of [[Twentieth Century Fox]] and it brought very bad publicity for the film. The adulterous affair between Taylor and Burton made the publicity even worse. ''Cleopatra'' marked the only instance in cinema history that a film would be the highest grossing film of a year while still profiting a loss, thus establishing the film as, at the time, [[List of box office bombs|the biggest box office disaster in cinema history]]. The film's terrible reception also destroyed the reputation of director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], who had a very esteemed career for directing classics like ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'', ''[[All About Eve]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'', ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'', and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer]]''. It, in addition, destroyed the career of its well-known producer [[Walter Wanger]], who never worked in Hollywood or on another film again; he died five years later at the age of 74 of a heart attack. Much of the blame of the film's shortcomings, troubles, and failures can be pointed at Fox President [[Spyros Skouras]], whose inexperienced micromanagement on the film's production, considerable lack of interest in filmmaking, and selfish intentions and preferences destroyed both the great potential of ''Cleopatra'' and the legacy of Fox, until when [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] returned to take control again. It wouldn't be until two years later when [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s film adaptation of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' helped rescue Fox from bankruptcy, restore the studio's reputation, and become [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|one of the highest-grossing motion pictures of all time]].
* November 7 – The classic comedy ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' premieres and it boasts some of the finest [[all-star]] ensemble casts ever casted in a motion picture, as well as the finest ever in a comedy motion picture. It is also the first comedy film ever directed by [[Stanley Kramer]], who's best known for directing serious human drama films on controversial subjects like ''[[The Defiant Ones]]'', ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', and ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''.
* November 23 – ''Doctor Who'' first premieres in Great Britain. The show continues to this day, and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013.
* December 25 – [[Walt Disney]]'s production of ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' premieres. It is the second adaptation of [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' after the [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]] musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', the first cinematic adaptation of the novel, and the thirteenth cinematic adaptation of the legend of [[King Arthur]].
