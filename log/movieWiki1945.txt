==Top grossing films (U.S.)<ref>Box Office Digest, March 1946, p.18</ref>==
Box office numbers were reported at the time as a percentage compared to 'normal' business at each theater. For example, [[The Bells of St. Mary's]] was the year's biggest hit at  241% while [[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]] performed admirably at 182%. This is why exact dollar grosses for the period are unreliable at best.
