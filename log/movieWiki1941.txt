==Events==

''[[Citizen Kane]]'', consistently rated as one of the [[Films considered the greatest ever|greatest films of all time]], was released in 1941.

==Top grossing films (U.S.)<ref>Box Office Digest, March 1942</ref>==
Box office numbers were reported at the time as a percentage compared to 'normal' business at each theater.  For example, [[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]] performed at 220% while [[Citizen Kane]] did 130% (coming in a surprisingly strong 30th for the year).
