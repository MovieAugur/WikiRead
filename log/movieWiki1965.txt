The year '''1965 in film''' involved some significant events, with ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' topping the U.S. box office.

==Independent - New Hollywood or American New Wave Films in 1965==
Summer Children

==Events==
* February 15 - [[George Stevens]]' production of ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', a retelling of the account of [[Jesus Christ]], premieres in [[New York City, New York]]. It was a flop with critics and audiences and it discouraged production of religious epics for many years. It's notable today for its impressive landscapes, powerful and provocative cinematography, [[Max von Sydow]]'s American film debut performance, and final film performance of [[Claude Rains]].
* March 2 - The [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] film adaptation of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', directed by [[Robert Wise]] and starring [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Christopher Plummer]], premieres. It quickly became a worldwide phenomenon and an instant classic. It successfully displaced ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' to become, at the time, [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|the highest-grossing film of all-time]]. ''The Sound of Music'' is credited as the film that saved and restored [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] from bankruptcy after suffering from ridiculously high production costs and low revenue of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', two years prior.
* July 1 - [[Blake Edwards]]'s epic comedy ''[[The Great Race]]'', starring [[Tony Curtis]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Natalie Wood]], [[Peter Falk]], and [[Keenan Wynn]], premieres. Initially a flop with critics and audiences to begin, it is now today considered to be one of the finest slapstick comedy films ever made, due Edwards' direction, acting by its ensemble cast (particularly Lemmon's), [[Henry Mancini]]'s wonderful music, production values, its comedy, and its climatic pie fight.
* December 22 - [[David Lean]]'s film adaptation of [[Boris Pasternak]]'s ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', starring [[Omar Sharif]], [[Julie Christie]], [[Rod Steiger]], and [[Alec Guinness]], premieres and, like ''The Sound of Music'', quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. Its moral story and message of a love and the human spirit that defied against the communist Soviet Union have made the film a true classic by the critics and audiences and, later, the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|American Film Institute]]. In a decade of very difficult times for its studio, ''Zhivago'' became the most successful and acclaimed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film since ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' and the greatest MGM film since ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.
