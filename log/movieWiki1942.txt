==Top grossing films (U.S.)<ref>Box Office Digest, June 1943, p.18</ref>==
Box office numbers were reported at the time as a percentage compared to 'normal' business at each theater. For example, [[Mrs. Miniver (film)|Mrs. Miniver]] performed at 244% while Billy Wilder's directorial debut [[The Major and the Minor]] did a solid 155%. This is why exact dollar grosses for the period are unreliable at best.
