==Top grossing films (U.S.)<ref>Box Office Digest, March 1944, p. 14</ref>==
Box office numbers were reported at the time as a percentage compared to 'normal' business at each theater. For example, [[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]] performed at an extraordinary 254% while [[Thousands Cheer]] was a hit at 176%. This is why exact dollar grosses for the period are unreliable at best.
