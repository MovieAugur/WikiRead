The year '''1958 in film''' involved some significant events.

==Events==
* February 16 - "[[In the Money]]" by William Beaudine is released on this date. It would be the last installment of [[The Bowery Boys]] series which began back in 1946.
* The second instalment of Sergei Eisenstein's [[Ivan the Terrible (film)|Ivan the Terrible]] is officially released, having previously been shelved for political reasons. It would be the last of Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible trilogy as the director died during production on part III.
* May 15 - As the twilight of the movie musical was declining from people's interest and taste, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released a film that ended the popularity of movie musicals with dignity, class, eloquence, and respect. Directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], produced by [[Arthur Freed]], and written by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' set the standard of future film musicals on how it should be done and done right that will appeal and relate to audiences young and old, as well as to be taken seriously as a true art form of motion picture filmmaking (e.g. ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'', ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]'', to name more worthy and remarkable titles.) ''Gigi'' was released to tremendous critical and commercial success and became the highest grossing musical ever made by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], until ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'' in 1974. ''Gigi'' saw the final day of the twilight of movie musical, only until it was finally resurrected thirty-one years later that the film musical genre can finally be loved and respected again with ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' in 1989.
